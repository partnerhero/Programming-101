Functions homework!

https://repl.it/languages/nodejs

1. Copy and paste the following function into https://repl.it/languages/nodejs. Then inside the console.log(), call the function and run it.

const greeting = () => {
    return 'Hey there! :)';
};
console.log();

2. Write a function with no parameters that returns any string. Call the function inside a console.log() and then run it.

3. Write a function with one parameter that multiplies that parameter by 2. Call the function inside a console.log() and pass in the number 5 as an argument then run it.

4. Write a function that adds two parameters together. Call the function inside a console.log() and pass any two numbers as arguments. Call this function three times with three different sets of numbers.

5. Write a function that converts meters to feet. 1 meter is 3.28 feet, so your function block should multiply meters by 3.28. When calling the function, it should take meters as an argument.

6. Write a function with one parameter that returns true if it is greater than 50 and returns false if it is less than 50.

BONUS:
Write a function that checks two given numbers and returns true if one of the numbers is 50 or if the sum of both numbers is 50, otherwise return false.
