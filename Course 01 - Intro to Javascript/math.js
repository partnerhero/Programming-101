// SUM
// Operator: +
const sum = 5 + 5;

// Operator: -

//DIVIDE
//Operator: /
const divide = 5 / 5;

//MULTIPLY
//Operator: *
const multiply = 5 * 5;

    Chaining Operations

    Mathematical operations can be chained through parentheses, as you would
    in a calculator!

//TODO declare a constant with the value of a chained operation that performs a sum, a division
//and a multiplication, and log it to the console
