    1. Log 'I am programming!' to the console.
    2. True or False
        a. Running console.log('3.14159'); will output a number
        b. Running console.log(1337); will output a string
    3. Log two concatenated strings to the console.
    4. Create a variable to represent the words per minute you can type (you can estimate). Use the most up to date keyword (keywords: var, let, const) to declare your variable.
        a. Log this variable to the console.
        b. You practice and get better at typing by 11 more words per minute. Reassign the value of your variable below your original declaration.
        c. Log the variable to the console again to see the new value.
    5. Create a variable to represent the dinner you had last night. Since this value is not expected to change, make sure to declare it using the correct keyword.
    6. Never stop mathing around:
        a. Create a chained mathematical operation using three of the four operators.
            i. Log the result to the console.

    BONUS!
    Create a variable for an equation using the exponent operator (**). Create another variable that's a string stating "The solution is". Log both variables to the console so that the output shows on a single line.

Answers will be posted on Friday!
