// Basic mathematical operations can be done in Javascript using mathematical operators

// ADDICTION
// Operator: +
const sum = 5 + 5;
console.log(sum);

// SUBTRACTION
// Operator: -
const difference = 5 - 5;
console.log(difference);

// DIVISION
// Operator: /
const quotient = 5 / 5;
console.log(quotient);

// MULTIPLICATION
// Operator: *
const product = 5 * 5;
console.log(product);

/* 
    Chaining Operations

    Mathematical operations can be chained through parentheses, as you would
    in a calculator!

*/

const chainedOperation = (5 * 5) / 5;

// TO DO: declare a constant with the value of a chained operation that performs a sum, a division, and a multiplication, then log it to the console

const anothaOne = (5 * 3) / (9 + 1);
