// Basic mathematical operations

// SUM
// Operator: +
const sum = 5 + 5;
console.log(sum);

// SUBTRACT
// Operator: -
const subtract = 5 - 5;
console.log(subtract);

//DIVIDE
//Operator: /
const divide = 5 / 5;
console.log(divide);

//MULTIPLY
//Operator: *
const multiply = 5 * 5;
console.log(multiply);

/* 
    Chaining Operations

    Mathematical operations can be chained through parentheses, as you would
    in a calculator!

const chainedOperation = (5 * 5) / 5;

// TO DO: declare a constant with the value of a chained operation that performs a sum, a division, and a multiplication, then log it to the console

const anothaOne = (5 * 3) / (9 + 1);
